        This application attempts to use deep learning to detect Malignant skin cancer via images taken by your smartphone.
        Malignant Melanoma skin cancer develops on moles on the skin, which may have originally been benign.
        \n\n
        You may supply a single image or run multiple images of the same mole to get a more accurate average result.
        Press the play button to run the model.
        \n\n
        The History tab contains all the previous runs of the models in question, with their results and the date they were run on.
        \n\n
        When providing images please ensure they contain as much detail of the mole as possible in order to get an accurate result.
        \n\n
        This model achieved 75% accuracy when tested on the isic dataset, but accuracy cannot be guaranteed.
        This model is for research purposes only.
